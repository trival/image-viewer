# Trival Image Viewer

This is the repo of the local desktop version of Trival image libraries viewer.

The project aims to let you manage and browse your directory based image
libraries on your local computer. Later a sync server should enable you to view
and edit your libraries remotely from mobile devices.

## TODOS

### MVP (local library viewing)

- use json files as config persistence

### Remote Library viewing

- implement a remote server that allows to register local libraries for viewing
  and browsing on any device connected to the remote server.

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
